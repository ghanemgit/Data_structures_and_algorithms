# Merge Sort

# Challenge Summary
#### Merge sort is the sorting technique that follows the divide and conquer approach. This article will be very helpful and interesting to students as they might face merge sort as a question in their examinations. In coding or technical interviews for software engineers, sorting algorithms are widely asked. So, it is important to discuss the topic. The required is to write Create a method used merge sort technique to sort a given array.
