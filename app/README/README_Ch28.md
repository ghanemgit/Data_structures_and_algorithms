# Challenge Summary
#### QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

- Always pick first element as pivot.
- Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
- Pick a random element as pivot.
- Pick median as pivot.

## Approach & Efficiency
#### The approach I go is increase my skill to step over the algorithm step by step and recorde the result and make table contain the variables and its values at iterating moment.

## Solution
### Go [here](../src/main/java/CodeChallenges/Challenge28/App.java) and check my code and tun it in IDE.
