# Stacks and Queues
#### The Stack data structure is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle. also Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.


## Challenge
#### The first section of This challenge is to create a several methods that related with stacks data structure like push, pop, isEmpty and peek, and the second section is talk about make a methods in queue to enqueue, dequeue, peek and isEmpty for a queue.


## Approach & Efficiency
#### In this experience I have taken a lot of things 
- Learn about the Stack and Queue.
- Learn how to make proper functionality as problem required.
- Learn how to Create a lot of method to deal with the stack and queue like push, pop, peek, isEmpty and more.
- Make test to test all my functions.

#### The Big O for this challenge is O(1);

## API
### Stack
- isEmpty => Check the whether of the stack if empty or not.
- push => Insert element into the top of stack.
- pop => Return the top element from the stack.
- printAll => Print all element of stack.
- peek => Return the value of top element.

### Queue
- isEmpty => Check the whether of the stack if empty or not.
- enqueue => insert an element at the end of the queue
- dequeue => Removes the node from the front of the queue
- peek => return the Value of the node located at the front of the queue
- printAll => Print all element of queue.
