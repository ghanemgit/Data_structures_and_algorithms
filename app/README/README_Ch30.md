# Hashtable
#### Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.
#### Thus, it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data. Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hash technique to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from.


## Challenge

#### Implement a Hashtable Class with set(), get(), contains(), keys() and hash() Methods.


## Approach & Efficiency
- Set => This method allow us to add key and value to our hashTable.
- Get => To get specific value from our hashTable.
- Contains => Check if specific value exist in our hashTable or not.
- Keys => Return all the keys in our hashTable.
- Hash => Return the Index For the Key.



## API

- get()=> Method takes the key as argument and return the value of it.
- set()=> Method takes the key and the value as arguments, and check if that key is already exist then edit the value for that key.
- contains() => Method takes the key as argument and check if this key is existed in the hashTable.
- keys() => Method return the List of the keys which are in the hashTable.
- hash() => Method takes the key as argument and returns index in the hashTable for that key.
